# Dynamic Libraries in C

This project explores dynamic libraries in the C programming language. A dynamic library is a collection of code that can be loaded at runtime, allowing programs to link to functions and symbols defined in the library. This can help reduce program size and improve performance by only loading the necessary code when needed. Dynamic libraries are commonly used in C and other programming languages to share code between programs and developers.

To create a dynamic library in C, you first define the functions and symbols you want to include in the library. You can then compile the code into a shared object file (`.so` in Linux/Unix systems) using a compiler like `gcc`. Once the library is compiled, you can link to it from other programs using the `-l` flag and the library name.

Dynamic libraries can be a powerful tool for C programmers, helping to reduce code duplication and improve performance. However, they require careful management and versioning to ensure that programs continue to work as expected when libraries are updated or changed.
