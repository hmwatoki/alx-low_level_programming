HI THERE!!!In this project, I cover the basics of the C program compilation process, object-like macros, macro arguments, preprocessor directives, standard predefined macros, include guards, and common predefined macros.

Here's an example of an object-like macro:

#define PI 3.14159
This macro defines a constant called PI with the value 3.14159. You can use this constant throughout your program to make your code more readable and easier to maintain.

This projct is part of my SE journey with ALX africa. Happy coding..!!
