**Bitwise Operators in C**

Bitwise operators in C are a powerful tool for manipulating individual bits within a binary number. The operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). Each operator has a specific function and can be used to perform a variety of tasks.

One common use of bitwise operators is to set or extract a specific bit within a variable. For example, to set the third bit of a variable x to 1, we can use the OR (|) operator and the left shift (<<) operator:

x |= (1 << 2);
This code shifts the value 1 two bits to the left, creating the binary number 00000100. The | operator then performs a bitwise OR operation between this value and the original value of x, setting the third bit to 1.

To extract a bit at a specific position, we can use the AND (&) operator and the right shift (>>) operator. For example, to extract the fourth bit of a variable x, we can do:

int bit = (x >> 3) & 1;
This code shifts the bits of x to the right by three positions, resulting in the bit we want to extract being in the least significant position. The & operator then performs a bitwise AND operation between this value and the binary number 00000001, which extracts the least significant bit and stores it in the variable bit.

It's important to note that bitwise operators can be tricky to use correctly, and can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. It's also worth noting that some compilers may optimize code that uses bitwise operators differently, so it's important to test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
