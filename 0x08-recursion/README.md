Recursion in C - ReadMe File
Introduction:
Recursion is a way of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems that are of the same type as the original problem. The smaller sub-problems are solved recursively, and their solutions are combined to yield the solution for the original problem.

In computer science, recursion involves a function calling itself, either directly or indirectly. In this read me file, we will discuss the concept of recursion in C programming language.

Basic Concepts:
In C programming language, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself. Here are some important concepts related to recursion in C:

Base Case:
The base case is a condition when our recursive function stops calling itself and returns without any further recursion. Without a base case, the program would get stuck in an infinite loop.

Recursive Case:
The recursive case is a condition where the function calls itself one or more times with different arguments in each iteration.

Stack Overflow:
If we create too many recursive calls without returning out of it, we can end up with too many functions on the stack, leading to a stack overflow error.

Tail Recursion:
When the recursive call is the last thing the function does before it returns, it's called tail recursion. It is the most efficient type of recursion because the compiler can optimize it.
