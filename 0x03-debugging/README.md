*Debugging*


Debugging is a process of diagnosing and resolving errors in computer programs. It involves identifying a bug or issue, determining the cause of the issue, and fixing the issue so the program can properly run. Debugging is a critical part of developing software, as it ensures that programs run correctly, even in difficult and unexpected circumstances.

This README will provide an overview of debugging techniques, common debugging challenges and tips, and helpful resources for further learning.

Techniques
Common techniques used to debug a program include:

Tracing the code line by line (often called "stepping through" or "single stepping")
Adding printf statements to check values at any point in the program
Watching variables as the program runs (e.g., using a debugger like GDB)
Running the program with test cases (inputs/outputs) to identify where issues occur
Challenges
Debugging can involve some tricky and difficult problems, here are some of the most common challenges:

Logic bugs - These types of bugs involve the program not behaving as expected because of misinterpreting instructions or incorrectly following them.
Syntax errors - Refers to mistakes in how a language is written, such as spelling mistakes.
Infinite loops - Occurs when a program gets stuck repeating the same instruction set over and over again.
Timing issues - These occur when different parts of the program are running out of sync.
Tips
Here are some tips to help you become better at debugging:

Take your time and look through the code carefully.
Isolate the cause of the bug. Once you've narrowed down the potential problem area, work on it step by step to find the source of the error.
Don't make assumptions about the code - test it first.
Break the problem down into smaller pieces and use print statements to observe what is happening in each step.
Try to understand why the code is not working, instead of just looking for a quick fix.
Use debugging tools like debuggers or logging systems to monitor program behavior.
Finally, if you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from more experienced developers.
