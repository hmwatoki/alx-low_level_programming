**Singly Linked Lists in Low-Level Programming**


This project is all about learning how to implement singly linked lists in low-level programming languages. It's a great way to get a basic understanding of how linked lists work and how they can be used in your own programs.

To get started, all you need is a C compiler installed on your computer. Once you have that, you can compile and run the program using the commands provided in the README file.

The program includes several functions that make it easy to create, modify, and free linked lists. And if you're not sure how to use them, don't worry.

Overall, this project is a fun and challenging way to learn more about low-level programming and data structures. So why not give it a try and see what you can create?
