Using Command Line Arguments in C
If you're new to the world of programming..like me at the moment, using command line arguments might seem intimidating. Fear not! I will explore what command line arguments are and how to use them effectively in C.

What are Command Line Arguments?
When a user runs a program from the command line, they may want to pass additional information (i.e., data) to the program on startup. These pieces of data are called command line arguments.

Command line arguments can be used in many ways, such as providing configuration data, input/output files, or simple flags that turn on or off certain features of the program.
How to Use Command Line Arguments in C
Using command line arguments is a breeze in C, thanks to the built-in main function. Here's an example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int i;

    printf("Number of arguments: %d\n", argc);

    for(i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
Let's walk through this code a bit. First, notice how main now takes two parameters instead of none. The first parameter (argc) represents the number of command line arguments passed to the program. The second parameter (argv) is an array of strings containing the actual arguments.
